This is the first project that I have created to learn web development with CI/CD. The program is deployed on a cloud server in Heroku, continous integration is accomplished via Travis. The web page takes an array of integers on the leftmost box, and three integers to search for in the following boxes; returns true if all integers provided are within the list, false otherwise.
